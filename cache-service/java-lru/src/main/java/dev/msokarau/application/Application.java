// Implement cache service. Cache entries (objects) â€“ simple custom class with one String field. Your cache service should have 2 methods: get and put.
// Your cache service should fit next requirements:
// Max Size = 100 000
// Eviction policy
// Time-based on last access (5 seconds)
// Removal listener
// Just add to log of removed entry
// Give statistic to user
// Average time spent for putting new values into cache
// Number of cache evictions
// Support concurrency
